This repository contains two java programs that demonstrate basic operations on arrays:
<br>
    1: Traversing an array and checking whether elements are positive, negative, or zero
<br>
    2: Inserting an element at the end of an array
<br>

## 1. Traversing an Array and Checking Elements

**File:** `TraversingInArray.java`  
*(Note: Correct spelling from "Transversing" to "Traversing" is recommended)*

### Description:
This program demonstrates how to:
- Accept user input to fill a static array.
- Traverse through the array elements.
- Identify whether each element is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Zero**.
- Display the result with corresponding index positions.

### Key Concepts Used:
- Arrays
- For loop traversal
- Conditional Statements (`if-else`)
- Scanner for user input
