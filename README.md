This repository contains two C programs that demonstrate basic operations on arrays:
<br>
    1: Traversing an array and checking whether elements are positive, negative, or zero
<br>
    2: Inserting an element at the end of an array
<br>

## 1. Traversing an Array and Checking Elements

### Description:
This program demonstrates how to:
- Accept user input to fill a static array.
- Traverse through the array elements.
- Identify whether each element is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Zero**.
- Display the result with corsresponding index positions.

### Key Concepts Used:
- Arrays
- For loop traversal
- Conditional Statements (`if-else`)
- Scanner for user input

## 2. Insertion at the End of an Array using ArrayList

**File:** `InsertionAtEndOfArrayList.java`  
*(Note: Correct spelling from "Inseration" to "Insertion" is recommended)*

### Description:
This program shows how to:
- Dynamically insert elements into an `ArrayList`.
- Insert a new element at the **end** of the list.
- Display the final list after insertion.

### Key Concepts Used:
- `ArrayList` from `java.util`
- Dynamic Array handling
- Scanner for user input
- For loop for traversing `ArrayList`
